Laptime Simulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A repository for my Laptime Simulation study notes. These notes will include theory on topics such as vehicle dynamics, aerodynamics and race strategy simulation.

These notes are not intended to be comprehensive study guides for others, they are merely my own personal notes, created during my self-study, online courses and relevant training in the field of Laptime Simulation.
